						<p>
							Singapore-based OCBC Bank has started a pilot project to test artificial intelligence-based
							(AI) tools to counter money laundering. The bank has partnered with BlackSwan Technologies
							and Silent Eight for the testing of AI solutions. The collaboration is part of the second
							Fintech Accelerator Programme conducted by OCBC Bank’s Fintech unit, The Open Vault. The
							pilot project claims to increase the bank’s competency in countering not only money
							laundering but also terrorist financing. The companies use artificial intelligence to
							conduct research on individuals and artificial entities who are suspected of illegal
							financing. The research includes scanning of individual profiles, and mapping how suspicious
							transactions may be linked to one another to examine if they are fraudulent or illegal.
							Presently, this process is conducted manually, but introducing artificial intelligence is
							expected to enhance an analyst’s productivity by up to 100%. Increase in productivity is
							achieved by speeding up the process of research on computer, where for example, a research
							which takes about one hour to complete, can be completed within one minute.
						</p>
						<p>
							As per the bank, the process begins when a suspicious transaction from an individual’s
							account shows an unusual activity. The bank’s internal private investigation will look at
							the individual’s history and will determine whether or not such a transaction is usual or
							typical of the individual or is it really unusual. Analysts will also scan the individual’s
							social media accounts, search engines, databases to create a profile of the individual, to
							get a comprehensive understanding of banking patterns, associates and behaviors. Silent
							Eight's solution, which is one of the fintech solutions piloted, helps to automate the
							desktop research process by enabling Banking Horizon analysts to put together the suspicious
							individual’s dossier within just a minute. The solution provided by the second company
							BlackSwan Technologies uses artificial intelligence to analyses suspicious transactions and
							map them to a network of related transactions.

						<h3>London Stock Exchange partners with IBM to develop securities data blockchain Solution for

						<p>
							Borsa Italiana, a subsidiary of London Stock Exchange Group has entered into a collaboration
							with IBM for the development of securities data blockchain solution for European small and
							medium enterprises (SMEs). The blockchain solution to be developed by IBM will simplify the
							tracking and management of shareholding information. The new system is aimed at creating a
							distributed shared registry that contains records of all the shareholder transactions. This
							new implementation is expected to open up new avenues for trading and investment. For
							unlisted SMEs in Europe, the new blockchain solution will be designed to replace paper
							trading certificates that are commonly issued to private companies. The project will result
							in providing a highly digitised, streamlined and transparent process build by using
							blockchain technology to allow several parties, including from issuers, regulators and
							investors, to gain insight into company information.
						</p>
						<p>
							As privately owned SMEs do not have access to public stock exchange networks or are
							formalised credit structures, the new blockchain solutions is claimed to help SMEs in
							gaining improved access to credit and link into a broader and more mature investor
							ecosystem. LSEG is testing the use of blockchain technology in a financial business network
							where data segregation and confidentiality is vital. By working with IBM, a pioneer in
							building enterprise-class blockchain solutions, they are committed to building, testing and
							scaling our capabilities in emerging technologies over time. Sharing secure and transparent
							critical network data across shareholder networks is difficult using traditional system.
							“Blockchain is poised to help remove some of these barriers in traditional methods for the
							transfer of value – much as the Internet did for the exchange of information in the late
							1990s.

						<h3>Account number portability in India</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="single-post-info">

					<div class="single-post-image">

					<div class="single-post-content">
						<p>
							A senior Reserve Bank of India official asked banks to work towards Account Number
							portability in line with the telecom industry whereby a customer can retain their account
							number even if they switch to another bank. Deputy governor SS Mundra said this "will be a
							far-reaching step towards enhancing competition and improving customer service." Mundra had
							earlier said technological innovation and linking accounts to Aadhaar can make it easier for
							this to happen. For unhappy banking customers, this could be a relief as it will save them
							the trouble of going through the process of opening a new bank account each time they want
							to switch banks. This will also help you do away with multiple bank accounts. The enhanced
							competition could lead to better services too. Taking this step is not going to be an easy
							task for banks as there are many loopholes that need to be addressed on the technology and
							data-integration front. .
						</p>
						<p>
							Adhil Shetty, Banking Horizon CEO of Bankbazaar, says, "Banks will have to restructure their
							account numbering systems. Many of them have different methods and streamlining these will
							take time. This will also involve changes in their software integration systems." Another
							roadblock could come in the form of know your customer (KYC) procedures. The KYC and the due
							diligence done vary between banks and may not be accepted uniformly. Experts believe that
							there are chances that some people may switch banks too often to escape the net of the
							Prevention of Money Laundering Act. So, banks need to have a secure KYC norm in place to
							distinguish the genuine customers from the fraudsters. A report on bank account number
							portability by Finacle, the banking solutions product of Infosys Technologies, states that
							this facility is already present in Europe and Australia in different forms. In the United
							States, every bank account number indicates the bank and pin code of the branch owning the
							account. However, the mechanism to handle subsequent bank switches is still not in place.
